## Contributing Guidelines for Rust Open Source Projects

We are grateful for your interest in contributing to our Rust open source project! Here are some guidelines to help you make your contributions as smooth and successful as possible:

### Getting started

1. **Find an issue to work on.** Browse the project's open issues to find one that interests you and matches your skill level. If you're not sure where to start, look for issues labeled "help wanted" or "good first issue."
2. **Fork the repository and create a branch.** This will create a copy of the project's codebase that you can work on without affecting the main project.
3. **Make your changes.** Be sure to follow the project's code style guidelines and write tests for your changes.
4. **Commit your changes and create a pull request.** Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch and create a pull request. This will send your changes to the project maintainers for review.

### Code style

* Follow the Rust style guide: https://enso.org/docs/developer/enso/style-guide/rust.html.
* Use consistent formatting and naming conventions.
* Write clear and concise code.
* Add comments to your code to explain your thought process and make it easier for others to understand.

### Testing

* Write tests for your changes to ensure that they don't break the existing project.
* Use the project's existing testing framework, if there is one.
* If there is no existing testing framework, create one.

### Pull requests

* Include a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request title and body.
* Reference any relevant issues in the pull request body.
* Be responsive to feedback from the project maintainers.

### Community guidelines

* Be respectful of other contributors.
* Avoid personal attacks and flame wars.
* Be open to feedback and criticism.
* Help others when you can.

### Additional tips

* Start small. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick a small issue to start with and get your feet wet.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck on something, ask the project maintainers or other contributors for help.
* Be patient. It may take some time for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

**Thank you for your contributions!**

We appreciate your willingness to contribute to our project. Your contributions help us to make our project better for everyone.
